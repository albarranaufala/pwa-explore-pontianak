            <h1>History of Pontianak</h1>
            <blockquote>Never Forget History</blockquote>
            <p>The city was formerly the capital of the independent <a href="#" title="Pontianak Sultanate">Sultanate of Pontianak</a> and was founded on 23 October 1771 around an old trading station on the Borneo coast. It was built on swampy ground that is subjected to regular flooding by the river, requiring buildings to be constructed on piles to keep them off the ground. The name Pontianak refers to a story about ghosts that people in West Kalimantan refer to as <a href="#" title="Pontianak (folklore)">Pontianak</a> (a ferocious female ghost in <a href="#" title="Malay language">Malay</a>); it was a ghosts' nest until Syarif Abdurrahman Alkadrie and his army fought and extruded ghosts who attacked his group by shooting cannonballs. He then built a mosque and a palace, exactly on the location of the ghosts' nest, and settled. The mosque and the palace became the first buildings in Pontianak City. To this day, locals shoot carbide cannons made from logs every Ramadan and holiday events to pay tribute to the Sultan.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
